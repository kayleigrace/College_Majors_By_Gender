# Interrogating College Data 
## *A data analysis of college graduates and their majors sorted by gender, STEM and non-STEM, and median earnings.*

By Kaylei Nilson-Pierce


For this data analysis, I will be using the data set [College Majors](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors "College Majors Data Set") provided by [FiveThirtyEight's Github Repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data "FiveThirtyEight Repository Homepage"). This data was provided by the contributer [Ben Casselman](https://github.com/BenCasselman "Ben's Homepage"). Ben Casselman also wrone an article, ["The Economic Guide to Picking A College Major"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/) using the same data sets.
