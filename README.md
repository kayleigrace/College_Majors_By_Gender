>I found this data in FiveThirtyEight's data sets. The title of the data set is "sleeping-alone-data," and Andrew Flowers is the contributer. The data set is in a .csv file and >recieved 1,057 responses from American adults in some form of a relationship and their sleeping habits. Mona Chalabi wrote an article, "Dear Mona, How Many Couples Sleep in >Seperate Beds," that analyzes some of this data. To download the .csv file from githum I clicked on the "raw" button and saved the webpage to my computer, then I uploaded this >file to the "upload" section of this repository. 
>You can find the data here [Sleeping Alone Data] (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/sleeping-alone-data/sleeping-alone-data.csv "FiveThirtyEight Sleeping Data")
